Volunteer to Be Wealthy
=======================

_A fool and his money are seldom parted._

Here's a lightly tested theory about business and life that I am going to try out as my guiding principle. I will update this space with my experiences. Probably this becomes a blog.

Typically, finding a job or starting a business begins with the question "how much money can I convince people to give me?" I think a far more profitable first question is "how much value can I give away?"

Here's an exaggerated thought experiment to illustrate the point. Suppose I decide I want ten million dollars. I think "I know -- I'll find a million people who are each willing to give me ten dollars." I start by posting this request on Facebook, hoping people will spread the word. That doesn't seem to be working, so finally I spend a million dollars on stamps, envelopes, and time, to send a million people letters asking for their ten dollars.

That may seem like such a stupid example that it made no sense to even bring it up. But actually, I think most new business ideas amount to pretty much the same thing. I still start by deciding I want ten million dollars. I realize that I'll probably have to give people something for this. I happen to be a programmer, so I think "I know -- I'll write a piece of software. Then, I'll let everyone know they have to send me ten dollars to use it. That will get everyone excited right out of the gate! I'll have a million customers in no time!"

In both cases, I start out by deciding to convince a million people to do something they don't want to do. Brilliant! What could possibly go wrong with that?

Instead, the profitable place to start is this: "How much value can I figure out how to give away to people? How can I, with my particular situation and skills, deliver the largest possible benefit to other people without asking for anything in return?" The power of this starting point is that it is far easier to convince people to do something they will like. The more they will like it, the easier it is to convince them. (And yes, you still have to convince them. Or, better still, convince them to convince each other. People don't inherently like change.)

"But wait", you say. "I actually did want the ten million dollars. Are we going to get to that?" Indeed we are. There is nothing wrong with receiving ten million dollars. The issue is merely that if you start there, you make your job a thousand times more difficult.

Once upon a time, not so very long ago, there was a fairly geeky Harvard undergrad named Mark. He found himself obsessing over the question of how he could give software to people that they would absolutely, totally love. He tried some things that people didn't especially like, and then some things that they did like but that got him into some trouble, until finally he found something they really, really liked. Then they did tell each other what a great thing it was, and they all got quite excited about starting to use it. It spread like wildfire, although at first Mark didn't even know how to find enough money to keep it running, much less make any profit from it. That caused some problems, but Mark's software became Facebook, and Mark is now worth tens of billions of dollars.
