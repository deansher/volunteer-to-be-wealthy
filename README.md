Volunteer to Be Wealthy
=======================

_A fool and his money are seldom parted._

Here's a lightly tested theory about business and life that I am going to try out as my guiding principle. I will update this space with my experiences. Probably this becomes a blog.

Typically, finding a job or starting a business begins with the question "how much money can I convince people to give me?" I think a far more profitable first question is "how much value can I give away?"

Here's an exaggerated thought experiment to illustrate the point. Suppose I decide I want ten million dollars. I think "I know -- I'll find a million people who are each willing to give me ten dollars." I start by posting this request on Facebook, hoping people will spread the word. That doesn't seem to be working, so finally I spend a million dollars on stamps, envelopes, and time, to send a million people letters asking for their ten dollars.

That may seem like such a stupid example that it made no sense to even bring it up. But actually, I think most new business ideas amount to pretty much the same thing. I still start by deciding I want ten million dollars. I realize that I'll probably have to give people something for this. I happen to be a programmer, so I think "I know -- I'll write a piece of software. Then, I'll let everyone know they have to send me ten dollars to use it. That will get everyone excited right out of the gate! I'll have a million customers in no time!"

In both cases, I start out by deciding to convince a million people to do something they don't want to do. Brilliant! What could possibly go wrong with that?
